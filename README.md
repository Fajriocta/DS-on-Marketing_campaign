# DS on Marketing_campaign
In this section, i'm trying to do Exploratory Data Analysis in python. with Boost the profit of a marketing campaign and do some machine learning, K-NN and clustering

EDA_on_dataset1 = This data focuses on Exploratory Data Analysis

EDA_on_dataset2 = In this data, tyring to figure the Machine Learning
# Technical
programming language = python. ver 3.9.7

Seaborn Version: 0.11.2

Matplotlib Version: 3.4.3

# Content of Dataset
In this dataset there is 24 column

AcceptedCmp1 - 1 if customer accepted the offer in the 1st campaign, 0 otherwise

AcceptedCmp2 - 1 if customer accepted the offer in the 2nd campaign, 0 otherwise

AcceptedCmp3 - 1 if customer accepted the offer in the 3rd campaign, 0 otherwise

AcceptedCmp4 - 1 if customer accepted the offer in the 4th campaign, 0 otherwise

AcceptedCmp5 - 1 if customer accepted the offer in the 5th campaign, 0 otherwise

Response (target) - 1 if customer accepted the offer in the last campaign, 0 otherwise

Complain - 1 if customer complained in the last 2 years

children - total amount of children

SpendProducts - total amount of spent all products in the last 2 years

TotalAccepted - the amount of total number of accepted

TotalofPurchases - amount of total purchases quantity 

# Steps of EDA

1. Preparation Data

2. Cleaning Data
